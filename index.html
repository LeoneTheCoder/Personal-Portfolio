            <h2>Learning</h2>
            <p>I remember me in Middle School, I had very good grades but I realize later on that there is so much to do and learn other than what school provides. I started reading book in High School
                and it has been such a good feeling to be able to expand my knowledge. I also got into learning different languages. I want to visit Italy and France some day. I know English and Spanish.

            <h2>I'm Leonardo Saldana</h2>
            <p>One important thing about me is that I specalize in always learning. The quote I always think about is, "A day without learning is a day wasted."
                I keep myself busy with school, boxing, work, projects, and studying. I am proud of the person I've become with the challenges I've faced in this world. 
                I managed to get through every challenge and strive to succeed. That is the type of person I am. Nothing is too hard for me and If I fail, I'm going to 
                get back up and try again until I get it right.
